   abstract = {This paper is the synthesis of joint work realised in a technical forum group within the AgentLink III NoE framework, which elaborated on issues concerning self-organization and emergence in multi-agent systems (MAS). The work concluded on a common definition of the concepts of self-organization and emergence in MAS and the associated properties and characteristics. Also it developed towards an approach for selecting self-organization mechanisms using a number of selected reference case studies and a set of evaluation criteria.},

   abstract = {Banded vegetation communities are known from semi-arid and arid landscapes in many parts of the world, in grasslands, shrublands, and woodlands. The origin of the distinctive patterning has been the subject of speculation, a common view being that banding evolves through the decline of more complete vegetation cover because of climatic deterioration or through grazing disturbance. A simple model based on cellular automata is employed to test the hypothesis that plausible mechanisms of water partitioning in spatially unstructured plant communities can bring about the development of banding. It is shown that without any climatic change or external disturbance, strongly developed banding can emerge from an initially random distribution of plants. Physical processes underlying the water partitioning, some of which remain unresearched, are discussed, and management implications noted.},

@article{Saco2007,
   abstract = {The interaction between vegetation and hydro-logic processes is particularly tight in water-limited environments where a positive-feedback links soil moisture and vegetation. The vegetation of these systems is commonly pat-terned, that is, arranged in a two phase mosaic composed of patches with high biomass cover interspersed within a low-cover or bare soil component. These patterns are strongly linked to the redistribution of runoff and resources from source areas (bare patches) to sink areas (vegetation patches) and play an important role in controlling erosion. In this paper, the dynamics of these systems is investigated using a new modeling framework that couples landform and vegetation evolution, explicitly accounting for the dynamics of runon-runoff areas. The objective of this study is to analyze water-limited systems on hillslopes with mild slopes, in which overland flow occurs predominantly in only one direction and vegetation displays a banded pattern. Our simulations reproduce bands that can be either stationary or upstream migrating depending on the magnitude of the runoff-induced seed dispersal. We also found that stationary banded systems redistribute sediment so that a stepped microtopog-raphy is developed. The modelling results are the first to incorporate the effects of runoff redistribution and variable infiltration rates on the development of both the vegetation patterns and microtopography. The microtopography for stationary bands is characterized by bare soil on the lower gradient areas and vegetation on steeper gradients areas. For the case of migrating vegetation bands the model generates hillslope profiles with planar topography. The success at generating not only the observed patterns of vegetation, but also patterns of runoff and sediment redistribution suggests that the hydrologic and erosion mechanisms represented in the Correspondence to: P. M. Saco (patricia.saco@newcastle.edu.au) model are correctly capturing some of the key processes driving these ecosystems.},
